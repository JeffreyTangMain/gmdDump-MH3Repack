# gmdDump
Simple C# tool for dumping nicely formatted strings from Monster Hunter 3 G / Ultimate, Monster Hunter X & Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen (PC) gmd files.

Just drag and drop a file onto the executable or use gmdDump.exe file.gmd.

Only tested with MH3U/MH3G/MHX/MHW gmd but it might work with other MT Framework gmd files as well as long as they share the same gmd file format version.

MHW/MHX files will be extracted with the string identifiers. Import the file into excel as csv with seperator `_____` .

Support for DD:DA (PC) support might be spotty.
