# gmdDump
Simple C# tool for dumping nicely formatted strings from Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate gmd files.

Just drag and drop a file onto the executable or use gmdDump.exe file.gmd.

Only tested with MH3U/MH3G gmd but it might work with other MT Mobile Framework gmd files as well as long as they store the text data size at 0x018.
