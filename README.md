# gmdDump
This fork specifically adds the capability to repack MH3G/U GMDs and to repack multiple files at once.
It should be able to unpack multiple files at once without problem but there was no testing done with anything except MH3G/U GMDs.

Drag and drop the edited .txt onto the executable to repack it with the .header it created and the .table it'll create from the .txt.

# Original Readme Below

Simple C# tool for dumping nicely formatted strings from Monster Hunter 3 G / Ultimate and Monster Hunter Cross gmd files.

Just drag and drop a file onto the executable or use gmdDump.exe file.gmd.

Only tested with MH3U/MH3G/MHX gmd but it might work with other MT Framework gmd files as well as long as they share the same gmd file format version
